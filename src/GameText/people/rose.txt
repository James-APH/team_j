I guess you are wondering why I am sitting here instead of working.
It is a terrible things really. I think I watched the Diane get killed.
I didn't see much and I don't think anyone else saw anything either because
it happened behind that pillar. Look you can see her laying there still.
I tired to help but I couldn't do anything. She was dead before I got
to her. Look. There was no way to stop that much blood.
    
What did I see? Not much. I saw someone arguing with her for a short time.
I didn't get to see who it was. Then a short time later as I was coming
back from the kitchen with more wine, I saw someone quickly walk past her
where she is now and she fell. I have no idea who it was.
