"I can't believe what happened! I heard something going on in this room when
I was walking by. When I opened the door I saw a vase go flying across the
room and shatter! I heard a yell and a someone slammed a door. I am not
sure where they went since this is the only door in and out of the room.
When I walked into the room I found Scott laying there not moving! I wasn't
sure what to do! I think someone killed Scott! I noticed the door to the
armoire was open and the clothes were all over the place. I think there
might be a secret door there."
