"Hello. I assume you are the detective I called. We have a small problem
and we need you to fix it. The wife of the owner was found dead in the
ballroom. The party is still going on so we need you to be discrete.

There are nine rooms we need you to look into to find who did this.
We are not sure who did or when it happened but that is what you do right?

There is a help file when you need to reference things (ADD KEYBIND HERE).
You are able to make your guess at the end of the game.

Should you need anything you the owner Scott should be around somehwere.
He always needs to be doing something.
His wife's name was Diane.

Good luck and thank you."
