You enter the ballroom. You are greeted with the sound of people dancing
and music filling the air. You can smell the alcohol in the air and everyone
seems to be having a good time and no one notices you enter the room.

You notice there is someone sitting alone across the dancefloor. They do not
look like any of the guests. It looks like they might be a waiter. They are
sitting on a chair at a table crying.
