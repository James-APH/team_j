You drive up to the mansion. It is sitting on a cliff overlooking a lake.
It is a giant building with a lot of rooms and the windows are all lit.
There are vines growing all over the building, snaking their way up the walls.
It is early evening and the full moon is shining across the lake.
There is a slight breeze making it's way across the lake brining the sweet
smell of fresh flowers.
You enter exit you car and notice there are a lot of other cars parked in the
driveway. There must be a party going on inside even though you cannot hear
anything outside.

You enter the garden through a gate and you can smell the flowers and tress.
You can hear the fountain going in the middle of the garden and you can
hear the sound of fish swimming around in a small pond in the corner.

You are met next to the fountain by a security guard.
