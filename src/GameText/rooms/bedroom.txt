You enter the master bedroom and stop after you walked through the door.
There is a large four poster bed in the center of the room. The bed has been
used and the blankets and pillows are thrown all over the room. There are
pieces of a vase shattered on the floor. You aren't sure it was thrown or
dropped. It appears there is blood splatter on the wall on the other side of
the bed. There is a door visible behind a bookcase. It was locked. There is
no way for you to pass through. It must be some kind of secret passage.
You notice there is someone in the room.
