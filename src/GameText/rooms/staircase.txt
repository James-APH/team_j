You found your way to the central hub. You notice a few things.
There are two doors. One door is at the top of the stairs and one at the
bottom. The door at the top of the stairs likely leads to the attic.
The door at the bottom of the stairs likely leads to the cellar. You can
smell the scent of old oak comming from downstairs. 
There is someone sitting on the stairs shaking. You notice he is wearing
expensive clothing.
