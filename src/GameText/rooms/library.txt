You go through the door and you entered a library. It looks like it goes
unsused. There is a layer of dust everywhere. You see dustlest path leading
from the door of the library to another door on the right. There is a desk
sitting in fron of you with an open book sitting there. You also see footprints
coming from the bookcase. But, there are no footprints going to the bookcase.
Maybe there is something there?
