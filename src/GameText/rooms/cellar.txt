You walk into the cellar. It feel cool but dry. You can smell the oak barrels
and see the caskets stacked against the walls. There is a large wooden chest
in the center of the room. It is locked. You also see a stack of papers sitting
on top of one of the caskets. When you look closer, you notice it is a will.
It looks like it was drafted some time ago. As you read through the pages you
notice the Scott was main beneficiary of most of the fatherâ€™s estate.
