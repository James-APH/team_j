You climbed the stairs and tried to turn to doorknob, but
it didnâ€™t move. You remember you picked up a key and place it in the lock. 
The key opens the door. As you enter the room you notice a thick layer
of dust over everything. Nothing looks out of place. 
No one has been in this room in a very long time. 
It must be filled with lots of treasured memories long forgotten.
